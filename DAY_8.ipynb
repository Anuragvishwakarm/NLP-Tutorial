    "**Natural Language Processing (NLP)** is a subfield of artificial intelligence that aims to enable computers to process, understand, and generate human language. One of the critical tasks in NLP is tokenization, which is the process of splitting text into smaller meaningful units, known as tokens. Dictionary-based tokenization is a common method used in NLP to segment text into tokens based on a pre-defined dictionary."

Each word in the text is compared to the terms in the dictionary as part of the dictionary-based tokenization process, and the text is then divided into tokens based on the matches discovered.

Rule-based tokenization divides the text into tokens according to the textâ€™s characteristics, such as punctuation, capitalization, and spacing. Tokenization that is based on machine learning entails training a model to separate text into tokens based on a set of training data. To increase accuracy and efficiency, hybrid tokenization blends rule-based and machine-learning-based methods."
